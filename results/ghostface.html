                <img class="grow" src="../images/killer_pictures/ghostface.png">
                <p>A creepy Killer, able to Stalk his victims and sneak up silently using his power, Night Shroud. Affected Survivors will find themselves vulnerable and oblivious to his presence and must use all of their perception and awareness to protect themselves from his approach. His personal perks, I'm All Ears, Thrilling Tremors and Furtive Chase, give him the ability to locate Survivors, defend generators, and make his chases unpredictable. A stealthy killer that exposes survivors by stalking them, once exposed they go from healthy immediately to the dying state, which saves you a lot of time if done correctly.</p>

                <h2>Night Shroud</h2>
                <img class="grow" src="../images/icons/powers/night_shroud.jpg">

                <p>When your ability gauge is full you can press your power button to activate Night Shroud. While Night Shroud is active The Ghostface is granted the Undetectable status effect. What this means is that Ghostface's terror radius and red stain will disappear, allowing him to stealthily move around the map. When Ghostface performs a basic attack or is revealed by the survivors, Night Shroud is deactivated and needs to recharge. The standard cooldown is 30 seconds.</p>

                <p>While Night Shroud is active The Ghostface is granted a secondary ability. He's able to stalk survivors. To do this hold the power button to stalk your victims. You can also lean around corners to stalk your victims faster. As you stalk you'll notice the survivor begins to turn from white to red. This displays that they are becoming stalked. Once they become completely stalked your victim will be bright orange and gain the Exposed status effect. This means any attack is enough to put them in the dying state.</p>
                    
                <p>Press the active ability button (ctrl) to crouch as Ghostface. While crouched you move slower but are much more difficult to reveal. You do not need to have Night Shroud active to crouch.</p>

                <p>Survivors are able to pull you from your power, allowing other survivors to be aware of your presence. For a survivor to do this they need to look at you for a total of 1.5 seconds. Survivors that are fully stalked however, cannot pull you out of your power anymore. If a survivor does manage to reveal you, the game will give you an indication of the exact location of that survivor.</p>

                <h1>General Gameplay</h1>
                <p>As you load into the map and enter the first person perspective of the killer, your ability gauge is full and ready to use. You should use this the very second you're able to move since it's indefinite until you attack someone or are revealed by the survivors. Your first move should be to find a vantage point in the middle where you can stalk unaware survivors. You should always stalk them all the way to 99% and only finish the stalk once you're really close to them, or else they'll be able to run to safety and possibly outrun the duration of the exposed status effect. Always approach the survivors from unexpected angles to catch them off-guard, and activating Night Shroud in a loop to lose your red stain can get you some easy downs without the need of too much mindgaming.</p>
