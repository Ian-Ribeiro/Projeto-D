                <h1>Find out which killer suits you best</h1>
                <p>Dead By Daylight is an asymmetrical multiplayer horror game in which 4 survivors go against 1 killer. The survivors have to fix 5 generators to power up the exit gates and escape, while the killer has to prevent that by killing all of them. There are currently 28 different killers in-game, all with different powers and unique abilities. If you're struggling to choose a main, this quiz should help you find a killer that best suits your playstyle.</p>
