# Dead by Daylight Quiz

The aim of this project was to create a static website from scratch using HTML and CSS.

The idea behind the website is to provide users with a quiz that will help them determine which killer best suits their playstyle in the game Dead by Daylight. Based on the user’s answers, they will be redirected to the page of the killer that matches their preferences.

Since this is a static website, there is no JavaScript or scoring system implemented. As a result, the website will always redirect to Ghostface’s page.
